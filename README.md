# E-commerce-customer-segmentation-&-recommendation-technique

Customer segmentation is the process of splitting a customer base into separate groups based on how they act or what they buy. Some of these traits are demographics, buying habits, tastes, and more.A recommendation system is a piece of technology or software that tells people about relevant products or material. It looks at past data, user behavior, and tastes to find things, goods, or material that the user might be interested in.

When you put these two terms together, you probably get a "Customer Segmentation Recommendation technique" that sends customers into different groups and then gives each group unique suggestions. For instance, it could separate customers into groups and suggest materials or goods that are more likely to meet the specific wants and needs of each group.

We look into the growing field of online shopping in this project by looking at a trade dataset from a UK-based store that is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This file keeps track of all the deals that happened between 2010 and 2011. Our main goal is to make marketing tactics more effective and increase sales by dividing customers into groups. We want to turn the transactional data into a customer-centric dataset by adding new features that will make it easier to use the K-means clustering method to divide customers into separate groups. With this division, we'll be able to learn about the unique tastes and profiles of each group of customers. Building on this, we plan to create an advice system that will show top-selling goods to customers in each group who haven't bought them yet. This will improve the effectiveness of marketing and lead to more sales.

## Objectives:

### Data Cleaning & Transformation: 
                   Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers, preparing it for effective clustering.
### Feature Engineering: 
                   Develop new features based on the transactional data to create a customer-centric dataset, setting the foundation for customer segmentation.
### Data Preprocessing: 
                   Undertake feature scaling and dimensionality reduction to streamline the data, enhancing the efficiency of the clustering process.
### Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering: 
                   Segment customers into distinct groups using K-means, facilitating targeted marketing and personalized strategies.
### Cluster Analysis & Evaluation: 
                   Analyze and profile each cluster to develop targeted marketing strategies and assess the quality of the clusters formed.
### Recommendation System: 
                    Implement a technique to recommend best-selling products to customers within the same cluster who haven't purchased those products, aiming to boost sales and marketing effectiveness.
